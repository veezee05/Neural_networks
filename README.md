# Startup Success/Failure Prediction Model
## Overview:
This project implements a binary classification model using neural networks to predict whether a startup will succeed or fail based on various input features. The model is built using Python and deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, with a strong focus on preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
 Overview
Predicting the success or failure of startups is a complex task influenced by numerous factors like funding, team composition, market size, and innovation. This project applies a feedforward neural network to analyze structured startup data and classify them into successful or failed categories.

The model was trained and tested on preprocessed data with a balanced representation of both outcomes. Exploratory data analysis and feature selection were conducted to ensure maximum performance and generalizability.

## Technologies Used:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset:
The dataset used includes various features related to startups such as:

- Funding amount
- Industry type
- Founders’ experience
- Number of employees
- Geographic location
- Market type

Note: The dataset is assumed to be pre-cleaned and anonymized. For privacy and reproducibility, a sample or synthetic dataset may be used for demonstration purposes.
